SOMbrero 0.4-2
New features:
  Added a parameter that tunes the gradient descent step
  Added a graphical user interface, using shiny

********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.4
New features:
  Implementation of the "dissimilarity" algorithm to handle dissimilarity data
  Plots, quality functions and super-clustering have been updated to handle this
case

Code improvements:
  New way to handle distance calculations
  New way to handle the 'korresp' preprocessing (full matrix is now included)
  Slightly changed default values for Letremy's radius and neighborhood: they
are now exactly the same than in the original programs

Fixed bugs:
  Fixed bug with default options in korresp case
  Fixed bug with affectation step in korresp case
  Fixed bug for what="add" and type="graph" (node sizes were wrong)

Misc:
  Added markdown vignettes: one general and one for each case; hence, the
package now depends on R version 3.0 or higher
  Added citation file
  Added demos
  Removed unecessary tests and examples


********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.3
New features:
  Implementation of the "korresp" algorithm to handle contingency table
  Plots, quality functions and super-clustering have been updated to handle this
case

Fixed bugs:
  Bug fixed in the dendrogram of super-clustering (percentage of explained
variance was incorrectly displayed)
  Bug fixed in smooth.dist and umatrix (distances were reversed)


********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.2-2
New options:
  The argument 'the.titles' has been introduced in plot.somRes

New features:
  Implementation of a quality function for somRes object
  Implementation of a super-clustering for the resulting prototypes
  Implementation of a plot method for the results of the super-clustering


********************************************************************************
SOMbrero 0.2
Name changes :
  The argument 'scale' of 'somRes' object is now called 'scaling' (conflict with
  a R base function)

Argument changes :
  The argument 'dist.type' has been transfered from 'somRes' to 'myGrid' objects.

New options:
  Distance type on the grid   :   maximum, euclidean, manhattan, canberra, 
                                  binary or minkowski
New plots:
  Observations                :   color, lines, barplot, radar, boxplot and 
                                  names
  Prototypes                  :   lines, barplot, radar, 3d, poly.dist, umatrix 
                                  and smooth.disy
  Additional variable         :   pie, color, lines, barplot, radar, boxplot, 
                                  words, names and graph


********************************************************************************
