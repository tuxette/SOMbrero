* other features (easy)
** MC : ficelle -> check all features (especially 3D plots)
** MC : for lines, display all observations and not the mean
** improve predict for Heskes: maybe possible to do it entirely with a matrix
operation
** calculateProtoDist: use other type of neighbors (but add a parameter for the
radius because it should not affect the poly.dist plot)
** superclusters : make projGraph and output super-clusters for observations
** superclusters : allows to cut the super-classes afterward (method)
** add weights to observations
** kaski lagus
** implement weighted graphs projection

* other features (hard)
** repeat SOM and combine
** multiple dissimilarities
** kacm, kdij
** batch version

* implementation enhancement
** should maybe improve the distance handling and propagate it everywhere
** dissimilarity algorithm should maybe requires a "dist" type input

* package changes
** C++ for training

* shiny
** JB : remove variable names for somplot and scplot for Relational?
** JB : what is standard value for h in superClass?
** MC : add an option in input to indicate which variable contains the
observation name
