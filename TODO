* other features (hard)
** grid.topology: hexagonal
** repeat SOM and combine
** multiple dissimilarities
** kacm
** batch version

* other features (easy)
** add weights to observations
** init=pca
** radius.type=gaussian
** implement projectGraph
** kaski lagus
** add ANOVA for dissimilarity

* implementation enhancement
** should maybe improve the distance handling and propagate it everywhere
** colors handling in "names" seems to sometimes bug
** make a function for initializing colors init.color(clustering, def.color)
** dissimilarity algorithm requires a "dist" type input

* misc
** replace "arth800" by the mouse liver/gene dataset
