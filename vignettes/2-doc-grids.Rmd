# A basic vignette on grids in SOMbrero

#### Laura Bendhaiba, Madalina Olteanu, Nathalie Vialaneix

## Definition and purpose of a myGrid class object

Objects of class myGrid are made to depict a grid. To be able to create such 
objects, you have to load the package ```SOMbrero```.

```{r loading, results='hide', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(SOMbrero)
```

## Basic functions on a myGrid class object

In this section, we will consider only the four basic functions that can be 
applied on a myGrid class object:

* initGrid,
* print.myGrid,
* summary.myGrid,
* plot.myGrid.

### The initGrid function

The initGrid function initializes a new myGrid object. It has 3 parameters:

* ```dimension```, which is a vector of two integers. The first one is the x
dimension, the second one is the y dimension. The __default dimensions__ are
__x=5__ and  __y=5__,
* ```topo```, which is the topology choosen. The value of this argument must be
one of  these: ```square```. The__default value__ is __square__.
* ```dist.type```, which is the distance type. The __default value__ is 
__euclidean__.

The following **R** code initializes a new myGrid object of square topology, x 
dimension 5 and y dimension 6, and distance type ```maximum```.

```{r}
my.first.grid <- initGrid(dimension=c(5,6), topo="square", dist.type="maximum")
```

### The print.myGrid function

The myGrid object print function prints in the console the main features of the 
chosen object. The only argument is the object to be printed.

Considering the previously initialized grid, the print command is:

```{r plotFirstGrid}
print(my.first.grid)
```

### The summary.myGrid function

The myGrid object summary function is quite simple. It only prints the class of 
the object and then calls the print function previously described. The only 
argument is the object to be summarized.

```{r}
summary(my.first.grid)
```

### The plot.myGrid function

The myGrid object plot function draws the squared area corresponding to the 
object, in a new graphical window. It has 2 parameters:

* the object to be plotted,
* the color(s) to be used to fill the areas on the graph. The __default color__ 
is __white__. If only one color is given, all the neurons will be filled with 
this color. One can also give many colors: in this case, the number of colors 
must match the total number of squares. The map is filled from the bottom left
corner, up the column and then likewise in the next column to the right.

```{r plotRainbowGrid}
# plot without any color specification: squares are filled in white color
plot(my.first.grid)

# generating colors from the rainbow() function
my.colors <- rainbow(5*6)
plot(my.first.grid, neuron.col=my.colors)
```
