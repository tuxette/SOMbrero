\title{Dataset "Les Misérables"}
\format{
\code{lesmis} is an \code{\link[igraph]{igraph}} object. Its vertices
are the characters of the novel and an edge indicates that the two characters
appear together in the same chapter of the novel, at least once. Vertex 
attributes for this graph are \option{id}, a vertex number between 1 and 77, 
and \option{label}, the character's name. The edge attribute \option{value} 
gives the number of co-appearances between the two characters afferent to the
edge (the \code{\link[igraph]{igraph}} can thus be made a weighted graph 
using this attribute). Finally, a graph attribute \option{layout} is used to 
provide a layout (generated with the \code{\link[igraph]{igraph}} function 
\code{\link[igraph:layout.fruchterman.reingold]{layout_with_fr}}) for 
visualizing the graph.

\code{dissim.lesmis} is a dissimilarity matrix computed with the function 
\code{\link[igraph]{shortest_paths}} and containing the length of the 
shortest paths between pairs of nodes.

\description{
This dataset contains the coappearance network (igraph object) 
of characters in the novel Les Misérables (written by the French writter 
Victor Hugo).
}
\details{
Les Misérables is a French historical novel, written by Victor Hugo 
and published in 1862. The co-appearance network has been extracted by D.E.
Knuth (1993).
